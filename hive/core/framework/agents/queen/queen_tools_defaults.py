"""Role-based default tool allowlists for queens.

Every queen inherits the same MCP surface (all servers loaded for the
queen agent), but exposing 94+ tools to every persona clutters the LLM
tool catalog and wastes prompt tokens. This module defines a sensible
default allowlist per queen persona so, e.g., Head of Legal doesn't
see port scanners and Head of Brand & Design doesn't see CSV/SQL tools.

Defaults apply only when the queen has no ``tools.json`` sidecar — the
moment the user saves an allowlist through the Tool Library, the
sidecar becomes authoritative. A DELETE on the tools endpoint removes
the sidecar and brings the queen back to her role default.

Category entries support a ``@server:NAME`` shorthand that expands to
every tool name registered against that MCP server in the current
catalog. This keeps the category table short and drift-free when new
tools are added (e.g. browser_* auto-joins the ``browser`` category).

# Category additions — generally-available tools added to a category AFTER
# a prior release shipped.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# A saved ``tools.json`` sidecar is a frozen flat list of tool names — it
# never picks up a tool added to a category later. Two consumers heal that:
#
#   * ``grant_role_default_additions`` (preferred) — used by the GA tool
#     migration on runtime startup and by ``load_queen_tools_config`` when
#     the queen has a role default. Grants every addition whose GA-promotion
#     version is newer than the sidecar's ``saved_on_version``, when its
#     category appears in the queen's role default.
#
#   * ``infer_category_additions`` (legacy fallback) — used for queens
#     without a role default. Grants additions only when the saved
#     allowlist fully covered the category's pre-addition baseline. Skipped
#     for small categories to avoid coincidental baseline matches.
#
# In both cases, an addition whose version is <= ``saved_on_version`` is
# left alone — the sidecar was saved on a release that already knew about
# the tool, so its absence is a deliberate untick.
#
# When adding a tool to a category, add it to BOTH ``_TOOL_CATEGORIES`` and
# here, keyed by the release version that promotes the tool to GA (the
# version that ships this dict entry).
#
# Versions are compared by ``_parse_version`` as tuples of ints split on
# ``.`` — ``"0.2.19"`` → ``(0, 2, 19)``. Anything malformed/missing
# collapses to ``(0, 0, 0)`` so legacy sidecars without ``saved_on_version``
# receive every addition on first migration.
#
# GRADUATION: once a release cycle has passed and sidecars have had a chance
# to re-save, drop the entry from this table. The tool stays a normal
# ``_TOOL_CATEGORIES`` member; leaving it here forever slowly erodes the
# ``baseline`` set the legacy fallback compares against.
