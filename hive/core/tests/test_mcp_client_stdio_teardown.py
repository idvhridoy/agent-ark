"""Real STDIO round-trip: connect -> call -> disconnect must tear down cleanly.

Regression for the swarm hang. The old design entered the anyio-backed
``stdio_client`` / ``ClientSession`` contexts in one task (which then finished)
and exited them from a *different* task on disconnect, raising
"Attempted to exit cancel scope in a different task than it was entered in" and
leaking the MCP subprocess + sockets on every teardown. A single owner
coroutine now enters AND exits the contexts in the same task.

This drives a REAL FastMCP stdio server subprocess (real anyio cancel scopes),
unlike the mocked unit tests — so it actually exercises the fix.
